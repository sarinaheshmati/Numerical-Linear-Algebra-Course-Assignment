# Effect of an Orthogonal Matrix on an Ellipse

This project investigates the effect of applying an orthogonal matrix to an ellipse in 2D space. Specifically, it demonstrates that the transformation of an ellipse by an orthogonal matrix results in another ellipse, preserving the shape but possibly rotating it.

## Overview

The project uses Python to:
1. **Plot an Ellipse**: An ellipse is defined by its semi-major and semi-minor axes and is plotted in a 2D space.
2. **Apply Orthogonal Matrix**: A 2x2 orthogonal matrix is applied to the ellipse, rotating it while maintaining its elliptical shape.
3. **Comparison**: The original and transformed ellipses are plotted for visual comparison to confirm that the transformation results in a rotated ellipse.

### Key Concepts:
- **Orthogonal Matrix**: A square matrix whose rows and columns are orthonormal vectors, representing a rotation or reflection.
- **Ellipse Transformation**: The multiplication of an ellipse's coordinates by an orthogonal matrix results in another ellipse, typically rotated.

### Conclusion:
The visual comparison of the original and transformed ellipses supports the statement that the effect of an orthogonal matrix on an ellipse is a rotation, confirming that the transformed shape remains an ellipse.
