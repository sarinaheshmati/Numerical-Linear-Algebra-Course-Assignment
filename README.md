# Numerical Linear Algebra Course Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for a Numerical Linear Algebra course. Each project demonstrates the application of various numerical linear algebra techniques, providing practical examples and implementations in Python.

## Contents

The repository includes the following projects:

### 1. **Low-Rank Image Compression using SVD**
   - **Description**: This project uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress images by approximating them with low-rank matrices. The method is tested with different ranks to observe the balance between image quality and data storage efficiency.

### 2. **Power and Inverse Iteration for Eigenvalue Computation**
   - **Description**: This project implements power iteration and inverse power iteration methods to calculate the largest and smallest eigenvalues, along with their corresponding eigenvectors, for a given matrix.

### 3. **Thomas Algorithm for Solving Tridiagonal Systems**
   - **Description**: The Thomas algorithm is used to solve tridiagonal systems efficiently. The project demonstrates its application and evaluates the performance on large systems.

### 4. **Spectral Radius Convergence of the SOR Method**
   - **Description**: This project explores the convergence behavior of the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method. It shows how the spectral radius approaches 1 as the matrix size increases, indicating the method's diminishing efficiency for larger systems.

### 5. **QR Factorization Algorithm**
   - **Description**: The QR factorization algorithm is implemented to decompose a matrix into an orthogonal matrix \( Q \) and an upper triangular matrix \( R \). The project demonstrates the application of this technique in solving linear systems.

### 6. **Effect of an Orthogonal Matrix on an Ellipse**
   - **Description**: This project investigates how an orthogonal matrix transformation affects the shape of an ellipse in 2D space. It confirms that the transformation results in a rotated ellipse, preserving the original shape.
