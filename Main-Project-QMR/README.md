# QMR (Quasi-Minimal Residual) Algorithm

## Overview

The **QMR (Quasi-Minimal Residual)** algorithm is an iterative method for solving large and sparse linear systems. It extends the **MINRES (Minimal Residual)** method, which is designed for symmetric positive definite matrices, to handle a broader range of matrices.

## Description

- **QMR Algorithm**: A refinement of MINRES, tailored for non-symmetric or indefinite matrices.
- **Purpose**: Efficiently solves large, sparse linear systems.
- **Applications**: Suitable for various scientific and engineering problems where systems are too large for direct methods.

## Key Features

- **Flexibility**: Handles both symmetric and non-symmetric matrices.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for sparse matrices, reducing computational and memory overhead.
- **Convergence**: Provides rapid convergence for many problems, particularly those involving large-scale systems.
